# Mathematical Computing
This is a respository of some of the most important coursework from a course in mathematical computing I took at the University of British Columbia in 2019. It inludes the usage of NumPy and SciPy packages and covers topics such as solving differential equations numerically, linear algebra, numerical differentiation and integration, and other general applications of mathematical computing with Python. All code is my own. For use as a reference. For further reading, see the open source online textbook "Mathematical Python," avaliable at https://github.com/patrickwalls/mathematical-python
